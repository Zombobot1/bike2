KNOWN ANOMALIES

Vite reloads entire page
    If a file doesn't have capitalized function const B = () => {}
      It doesn't count: const B = () => () => {}
    If there is a circular dependency
    If problematic file A depends on B when you change B page will be reloaded

    How to test:
      Press Ctrl+S even without changes (sorybook tree will blink)
      Comment out imports and find problematic, then analyze which files are reloaded as well and what they depend on
      Move dependencies if possible to a separate file
      If nothing helps restart vite (sometimes it gets stuck)
