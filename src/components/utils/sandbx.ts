<p>Once upon a time there was a cat.  Her name was Pussy . She used to live in a small, beautiful house in a village.</p>
<p>It was summer and the sun was shining brightly in the sky. Pussy, the cat, was getting bored at home and thought, “Why shouldn’t I go out for a drive in the countryside and then to the beach.”</p>
<p>She came out of her house and took out her red-colored car. She started driving towards the beach.</p>
<p>Suddenly she heard a sound –  “<em>maa- maa</em>“.</p>
<p>She looked around and saw , there was a sheep standing by the road.</p>
<p>The sheep asked Pussy, “Hi! Can you drop me to the market please? I need to buy some vegetables and I have missed my bus”.<span id="more-11190"></span></p>
<p>Pussy replied, “Yes off course, please come in”.</p>
<p>Both the cat and the sheep started driving towards the market. They reached the market and Pussy dropped the sheep off.</p>
<p>Pussy thought, “I must rush now otherwise I will be late for the beach.” She started driving again.</p>
<p>Suddenly a big bear came and stopped in front of her car. The bear said, “Where are you going silly cat?”</p>
<p>Pussy was scared and replied, “I am going to the beach”.</p>
<p>The bear said, “Can you take me along with you?”</p>
<p>Pussy thought, “If I say no to him , then he might harm me.” So she said, “Yes Sir, please come in”.</p>
<p>Now both the cat and the bear started towards the beach.</p>
<p>They were about to reach the beach, but suddenly… the car stopped in the middle of the road.</p>
<p>The bear asked the cat, “What happened? Why the car has stopped?”</p>
<p>Pussy replied, “Sir, please wait, let me check”.</p>
<p>Pussy checked the car – she checked under the bonnet and looked at the wheels – but she could not find the problem. She looked around to see if there was anyone she could ask for help.</p>
<p>She saw a monkey sitting on a tree, eating bananas. Pussy asked the monkey, “Can you please help me? My car has stopped suddenly and I need to go to the beach”.</p>
<p>The monkey told her, “Wait, let me finish my bananas , then I will come down’. Both the cat and the bear waited for the monkey  to finish the bananas.</p>
<p>Finally the monkey finished his bananas and came down. He looked around the car and peeked at the engine. He fiddled around with a few wires and soon had the car fixed. The car was now working perfectly.</p>
<p>Pussy and the bear were happy. Now they could go to the  beach.</p>
<p>Pussy said, “Thank you” to the monkey.</p>
<p>Monkey said, “If you are really thankful, then please take me along to the beach with you”.</p>`
